# Scalability Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the strategy for scaling the CoreChain Climate Network to support over 10,000 concurrent users and 50,000 IoT devices while maintaining high performance and reliability. Our approach is based on horizontal scaling across the database, backend services, and blockchain layers.

## 2. Performance Targets

-   **Concurrent Users**: 10,000+
-   **IoT Devices**: 50,000+
-   **API Response Time**: < 200ms (95th percentile)
-   **Blockchain Throughput**: 1,000+ TPS (on Layer 2)
-   **Data Ingestion Rate**: 1M+ messages/minute

## 3. Database Scaling Strategy

-   **PostgreSQL (Relational Data)**:
    -   **Read Replicas**: Implement multiple read replicas to distribute the load of read-heavy operations.
    -   **Connection Pooling**: Use a connection pooler like PgBouncer to manage database connections efficiently.
    -   **Sharding**: For extreme scale, shard the database by user ID or another logical key.
-   **InfluxDB (Time-Series Data)**:
    -   **Clustering**: Run InfluxDB in a clustered configuration to distribute data and query load across multiple nodes.
    -   **Downsampling**: Automatically downsample high-resolution data into lower-resolution aggregates for long-term storage and faster queries.
-   **Redis (Caching)**:
    -   **Clustering**: Use Redis Cluster to shard data across multiple nodes, enabling horizontal scaling of the cache.

## 4. Backend Services Scaling Strategy

-   **Microservices Architecture**: The backend is designed as a set of independent microservices, allowing each service to be scaled independently based on its specific load.
-   **Container Orchestration**: All services will be containerized using Docker and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.
-   **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**: Kubernetes will automatically scale the number of pods for each service up or down based on CPU and memory usage.
-   **Asynchronous Processing**: Use Kafka as a message bus to decouple services and handle load spikes through asynchronous processing.
-   **Load Balancing**: An NGINX Ingress Controller will distribute incoming traffic across the available service pods.

## 5. Blockchain Scaling Strategy

-   **Layer 2 (L2) Rollups**: The majority of high-frequency transactions (e.g., data submissions, reward distributions) will be processed on an L2 scaling solution like Arbitrum or Polygon to achieve high throughput and low gas fees.
-   **Data Aggregation**: IoT data will be aggregated off-chain and submitted to the blockchain in batches to minimize the number of on-chain transactions.
-   **State Channels**: For specific real-time interactions, state channels can be used to allow parties to transact off-chain, only settling the final state on-chain.
-   **Optimized Smart Contracts**: Contracts will be written with gas efficiency in mind, using best practices to minimize computational complexity.
